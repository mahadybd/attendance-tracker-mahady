# Attendance Tracker

A web application for tracking attendance. This project uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS for the front-end styling. It also supports features like authentication, session management, and email notifications.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login, register, and logout functionality with JWT authentication.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Track the attendance of users, including timestamps and status.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email alerts for certain actions.
- **Data Storage**: Uses MongoDB to store user and attendance data.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routes and HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing attendance and user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB to simplify data interaction.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for secure user authentication.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending emails.
- **Moment.js**: For date/time handling.
- **Nodemon**: For automatic server reloading during development.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can check the installation by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

- **MongoDB**: You will need a MongoDB database. You can use a local MongoDB installation or a cloud-based service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-tracker.git
   cd attendance-tracker
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
     EMAIL_USER=your_email
     EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
     ```

4. **Build the Tailwind CSS**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will run the server with `nodemon`, and it will automatically restart when changes are made.

6. **Access the app**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Register**: Create a new account using the registration form.
- **Login**: Use the login form to authenticate.
- **Track Attendance**: After logging in, you can start tracking attendance.
- **View Attendance**: View the recorded attendance for the logged-in user.
- **Email Notifications**: Get notifications on important actions, such as when attendance is marked.
